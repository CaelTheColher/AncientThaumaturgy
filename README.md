# AncientThaumaturgy

A WIP magic mod for Fabric heavily inspired by Azanor's [ThaumCraft 2](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1279034-1-2-5-thaumcraft-2-1-6d-outdated)

All the names are very temporary.

This mod is also VERY work-in-progress, don't expect anything playable for a while.
